# Client-Server Applications

This repository will hold projects which use a client-server architecture. 

## Purpose

As I start to learn more advanced programming concepts, I would like to try incorporating them in more advanced structures as well. These projects will serve to help me learn and practice developing apps using a less centralized model.
