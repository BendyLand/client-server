# Client - Server App in Python

This directory will store a client - server style application written in Python.

## Purpose

I am trying to branch into more advanced programming topics, such at utilizing a less centralized structure for my apps. This project will serve as an introduction to client - server style architecture while still staying at a relatively small scale. It is more for me to become familiar with common setups, functionalities, and considerations when working with this style of project.
